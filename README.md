# Vulnerability Assessment Report
21st May 2024

---
# System Description

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.
# Scope

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 2024 to August 2024. [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRpdpQMEWskxSkwqEMv8W7A7x8GXQlcn0hEcDzWet3Y/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-3GRRWAd8HryVgof-Jc33yA) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.
# Purpose

Consider the following questions to help you write:

- How is the database server valuable to the business? The database server is extremely valuable to the company. The database contains the PII of potential customers, indicating that it contains PII. 

- Why is it important for the business to secure the data on the server? In the event that the server is compromised, all of the data is compromised as well.  

- How might the server impact the business if it were disabled? Being disable means that none of the remote employees can obtain potential customers. At the very least, the sales department would not be able to query for potential customers and sales would slow. 
# Risk Assessment

|Hacker or Competitor|Perform reconnaissance and surveillance of<br><br>organization|2|2|4|
# Approach

While looking through the potential threat events, I wanted to focus on events that would be easiest for someone to do. If a threat actor finds the server performing surveillance and conducting a DoS attack would be fairly simple. Because they are public facing, simply having the ability to send data to the server (even without receiving data back) creates a vulnerability. The fact that the server is open to the public makes this even more likely. 

In the event that the server is discovered, obtaining sensitive data would be simple, quick, and the threat actor could easily cover their trails. If a malicious program goes unnoticed for long enough the threat actor can continue to gather data for as long as the malicious program is installed. 
# Remediation Strategy

In order to remediate these strategies authentication with MFA should be enabled. As well, a firewall should be installed to monitor and block unwanted traffic from reaching the server. Lastly, encrypting the database will help significantly reduce the risk that even if a threat actor gets past the authentication and the firewall, data is not easily compromised.
